MY SQL ASSIGNMENT!
Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard language used to store, retrieve, and manage data in relational databases. In this assignment, two tables were created to demonstrate basic SQL operations: the **department** table and the **employees** table. These tables represent a common database structure where one table stores department-related information, while the other contains employee details and includes a foreign key that links each employee to a specific department.

Several SQL features were applied throughout the assignment. **Data Definition Language (DDL)** commands were used to create the tables, define primary keys, and establish relationships through foreign keys. **Data Manipulation Language (DML)** commands were used to insert values into both tables.

The assignment also uses **aggregate functions** such as `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `SUM`, and `AVG` to analyze numerical data like employee salaries. **String functions**, including `UPPER`, `LOWER`, `LENGTH`, and `SUBSTRING`, help manipulate and format text. **Numeric functions** like `ROUND`, `CEIL`, and `FLOOR` were used to perform mathematical operations.

A **CASE expression** was used to categorize employees based on their salary, demonstrating conditional logic in SQL. Additionally, **JOIN operations** such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN were performed to retrieve records from multiple tables based on related columns. These joins show how relational databases connect different sets of information to produce meaningful results.

Overall, this assignment demonstrates how SQL can be used to create tables, store data, perform calculations, manipulate text, and retrieve information through powerful querying techniques. It covers essential SQL concepts required for working with relational databases.
